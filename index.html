    <h2 class="leftSide medium">About Me</h2>
    <p class="leftSide">Hello! I hope you're doing well. My name is Aryavrat Mishra and I'm a sophmore at Rocklin High
      School. I enjoy programming and playing tennis on the school team. I also enjoy math and playing in the school
      band, and also in a jazz band. I play the trombone, and I've been playing it for about 3-4 years. I also have
      really gotten into chess recently, and my rating is about 1100. Overall, life is pretty good.</p>

  <div class="grey">
    <h2 class="center medium">Programming</h2>
    <p class="center">I really love programming. I even made this website by myself, along with a handful of other
      simple half-baked projects. I typically enjoy Python, and my front-end development is better than my back-end
      development. I've joined a few hackathons(never did manage to win any), and I've recently been playing around with
      AI, altough I don't have any projects to show for it yet.</p>
